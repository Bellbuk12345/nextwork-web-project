# NextWork Web Project – DevOps Learning Journey 

This project started as a simple Java/JSP web application, and evolved into a hands-on DevOps practice where I built a real CI/CD pipeline using AWS services.  
It represents my learning process, the mistakes I made, the debugging I did, and the real skills I gained along the way.

## 1. Application
 

This is a Maven-based Java web application (`maven-archetype-webapp`) with a basic JSP page. Throughout this project, I explored how to package it as a WAR file and how to deploy it in a cloud environment.

I used this application to practice building a **CI/CD pipeline** on AWS using CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, EC2, and S3.

## 2. Tech Stack

### **Application**
- Java 17  
- JSP + Servlets  
- Maven  

### **DevOps / AWS**
- AWS CodeBuild  
- AWS CodeDeploy  
- AWS S3  
- AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux 2)  
- Tomcat server  
- Apache httpd  
- IAM Roles  
- Bash scripts  

### **Tools**
- Git & GitHub  
- VS Code  
- Linux terminal

## 4. ** CI/CD Pipeline Overview **

GitHub Repo
   |
   | (Push)
   v
AWS CodeBuild
   - compiles Java app
   - packages WAR file
   - bundles scripts + appspec.yml
   - uploads ZIP to S3
   |
   v
AWS S3 (artifact storage)
   |
   v
AWS CodeDeploy
   - reads appspec.yml
   - copies files to EC2
   - runs lifecycle scripts
   |
   v
EC2 (Amazon Linux 2 with CodeDeploy Agent)
   - runs the Java web application on Tomcat
---

## 5. **Key Configurations**

### buildspec.yml

Defines the CodeBuild process:

- logs into CodeArtifact (for Maven dependencies)
- runs Maven build
- packages the artifact
- uploads files to S3

### appspec.yml

Defines the deployment workflow:

- where files go on EC2
- what scripts to run before/after deployment

### scripts/

Automation scripts used by CodeDeploy:

- install dependencies
- start/stop Tomcat and httpd
- prepare the server for deployment

---
## 6. **Running the App Locally**
To build locally:
Run "mvn clean package"
It then create "target/nextwork-web-project.war"

---
## 7. **Deployment on AWS**
To deploy using CodeDeploy, the EC2 instance should have:
- Amazon Linux 2
- CodeDeploy Agent installed
- Tomcat installed
- HTTP(80), SSH(22) open
- Correct IAM roles
- S3 access
- Lifecycle hooks enabled

Deployment Steps:
- Push code to github
- Start CodeBuild
- Confirm artifact in S3
- Create a new CodeDeploy Deployment
- App is copied + scripts executed
- App becomes availaible on 
---
## 8. **Project Status (Honest Note)**
This projec represent my real DevOps learning process.

Here is what I successfully built:
- The java web application
- A complete CodeBuild pipeline
- A complete CodeDeply deployment flow
- Deployment scripts (install, stop, start)
- An S3 artifact structure with WAR + appspec.yml + scripts
- Understanding of instance tagging for deployments
- Practical debuging of IAM, EC2, S3 and deployment errors
---
I paused before fully completeing the final production deployment step due to cost and resource limitations. However, the core CI/CD pipeline, scripts and AWS configuration work were completed, and I gained a valuable experience.

## 9. **What I Learned**

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Write and use buildspec.yml
- Write and use appspec.yml
- Configure CodeBuild and CodeDeploy
- Manage EC2 instances and SSH
- Handle AWS IAM permisisions
- Debug real-world deployment issues
- Wort with an S3 as an artifact store
- Understand how CI/CD pipelines are structured
